# kutilmilan — Website

This repository now contains a minimal static website skeleton:

- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — simple responsive styles
- `README.md` — this file

How to preview locally
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/Max-Glad/kutilmilan.git
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (double‑click), or run a simple local server:
   - Python 3: python3 -m http.server 8000
   - Then open: http://localhost:8000

How to publish with GitHub Pages
1. Push the files to the `main` branch (already done).
2. In the repository Settings → Pages, set the source to Branch: `main` and Folder: `/ (root)`.
3. Save — the site will be available at `https://Max-Glad.github.io/kutilmilan/` (or the site URL shown by GitHub Pages).

What I changed
- Added `styles.css` and `README.md` to complete the basic website skeleton.

Next steps
- Enable GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages) to publish the site publicly.
- Optionally add a custom domain or deploy with Netlify/Vercel for advanced features.
